Subject: [PATCH 62/124] rbd: don't drop the rbd_id too early

Git-commit: 32eec68d2f233e8a6ae1cd326022f6862e2b9ce3
Patch-mainline: v3.4
References: FATE#312404

Currently an rbd device's id is released when it is removed, but it
is done before the code is run to clean up sysfs-related files (such
as /sys/bus/rbd/devices/1).

It's possible that an rbd is still in use after the rbd_remove()
call has been made.  It's essentially the same as an active inode
that stays around after it has been removed--until its final close
operation.  This means that the id shows up as free for reuse at a
time it should not be.

The effect of this was seen by Jens Rehpoehler, who:
    - had a filesystem mounted on an rbd device
    - unmapped that filesystem (without unmounting)
    - found that the mount still worked properly
    - but hit a panic when he attempted to re-map a new rbd device

This re-map attempt found the previously-unmapped id available.
The subsequent attempt to reuse it was met with a panic while
attempting to (re-)install the sysfs entry for the new mapped
device.

Fix this by holding off "putting" the rbd id, until the rbd_device
release function is called--when the last reference is finally
dropped.

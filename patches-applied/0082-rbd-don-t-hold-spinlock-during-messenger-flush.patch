Subject: [PATCH 82/124] rbd: don't hold spinlock during messenger flush

Git-commit: cd9d9f5df6098c50726200d4185e9e8da32785b3
Patch-mainline: v3.5-rc1
References: FATE#312404

A recent change made changes to the rbd_client_list be protected by
a spinlock.  Unfortunately in rbd_put_client(), the lock is taken
before possibly dropping the last reference to an rbd_client, and on
the last reference that eventually calls flush_workqueue() which can
sleep.

The problem was flagged by a debug spinlock warning:
    BUG: spinlock wrong CPU on CPU#3, rbd/27814

The solution is to move the spinlock acquisition and release inside
rbd_client_release(), which is the spot where it's really needed for
protecting the removal of the rbd_client from the client list.

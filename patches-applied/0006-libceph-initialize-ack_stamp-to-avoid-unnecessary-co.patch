Subject: [PATCH 6/124] libceph: initialize ack_stamp to avoid unnecessary connection reset

Git-commit: c0d5f9db1c7d1b8a9e2f217706e8ea233bac2754
Patch-mainline: v3.1
References: FATE#312404

Commit 4cf9d544631c recorded when an outgoing ceph message was ACKed,
in order to avoid unnecessary connection resets when an OSD is busy.

However, ack_stamp is uninitialized, so there is a window between
when the message is sent and when it is ACKed in which handle_timeout()
interprets the unitialized value as an expired timeout, and resets
the connection unnecessarily.

Close the window by initializing ack_stamp.

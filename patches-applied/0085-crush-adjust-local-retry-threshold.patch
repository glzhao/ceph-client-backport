Subject: [PATCH 85/124] crush: adjust local retry threshold

Git-commit: c90f95ed46393e29d843686e21947d1c6fcb1164
Patch-mainline: v3.5-rc1
References: FATE#312404

This small adjustment reflects a change that was made in ceph.git commit
af6a9f30696c900a2a8bd7ae24e8ed15fb4964bb, about 6 months ago.  An N-1
search is not exhaustive.  Fixed ceph.git bug #1594.
